Based on the same VW Group J1 platform that underpins the Porsche Taycan, the Audi e-Tron GT is a four-door GT that's compellingly exciting to drive.

We can talk about how it can warp speed and bend the time-space continuum with a dab of right foot, but instead, we look at the Audi E-Tron GT for what it is – a grand tourer.

After driving the AudiE-Tron GT, there’s a new entry on my bucket list – traversing cross-country across the European continent in the Audi E-Tron GT. It’s got a GT in its name after all and a proper grand tourer it is. The E-Tron GT is comfortable, fast, futuristic, and unpredictably practical as well. With a claimed range of 500km, a big battery pack, and superlative electronic wizardry, the Audi E-Tron GT can be a daily runabout as easily as a mile muncher. It’s no Italian thoroughbred, but it need not be because the E-Tron GT is leagues ahead in the future.<br>
<h3><center><b><i><ins>Engine and Performance</ins></i></b></center></h3><br>
What we have here is not the top-tier E-Tron GT, there’s a 645bhp RS version available for quite a lot more money. Who would find 523 horsepower (in boost mode) and 630Nm something to scoff at? Or decree its 0-100kmph time of 4.1 seconds to be slow. The two motors on both axles are fed through a 93kWh battery pack. We can talk about how it can warp speed and bend the time-space continuum with a dab of right foot, but instead, we look at the E-Tron GT for what it is – a grand tourer. <br>
When it’s ready to roll, artificial noises emanate from the E-Tron GT’s speakers to make up for the lack of mechanical sound. On the move, this GT is smooth, undramatic, and progressive. However, when launching the E-Tron off the mark in boost mode, all of the 534 horsepowers is put down to the tarmac and the GT launches into the horizon with an eerie silence, while your internals are courteously rearranged. <br>
Unique to the E-Tron GT is the two-speed transmission for the rear-axle motor – a lower gear for slow speed drives, and a higher gear for higher speeds. And you can feel the transmission shift when hurriedly barreling down a smooth piece of tarmac. Behind the wheel, the GT is sufficiently quick yet comfortable for everyday drivability. Yet it isn’t intimidating or scary when pushed a little. All of the usable power is channelled to the road quite intelligently and though you’d sometimes feel the wheel spin under acceleration, it’s always under control, helped by traction sent to all four wheels, courtesy of e-quattro. <br>
What’s more, when braking, it’s the electric motors that work more than actual brakes to decelerate recuperating energy in the process. Meanwhile, the paddle shifters behind the steering are for brake energy regeneration, which cannot be manually controlled. That said, it is reassuring to know there’s good braking prowess to keep things under control when pushing the E-Tron GT.<br>
